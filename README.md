# Todo App Custom

## Introduction

This is a simple implementation of an old tutorial I made when I started learning React.

I made small new tweaks on my own to improve and re-use others skills I learned on other project.

***N.B. : Word with caps first letter are components of this application.***

## Home page

This is the App main page with :

- All Tasks in our queue (finish/unfinished);
- The Button to show/unshow the form and create new Task.

Each Task has two little action icon :

- A *green* "Done" icon to validate our Task;
- An *blue* "Archive" icon to archive and hide a Task. This icon is available only when a Task is done.

We also have our Header with every link to navigate on our application.

## Archived Page

This page gathers every archive. Two actions are also possible here :

- A *red* "X" icon to completely delete our Task. A confirm alert window will pop;
- A *blue* "Archive" icon to unarchive our Task and put it on the App main page.

## About Page

A simple about page regarding this application.

## Last note

I will start to nicely improve this application as part of my journey on use JS framework and personal training, or even "sandbox" to experiment new stuffs.

This is among my first push on GitHub and hope to see you soon on other project. Peace.
